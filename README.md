## Project overview

This project focuses on predicting diabetes among individuals using a dataset that includes medical information like glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and more. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of diabetes, which can be valuable for early intervention and management strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset is split into two parts: a training set and a testing set. Each set includes features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and an Outcome indicating whether the individual has diabetes.

## Features
* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

## Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
